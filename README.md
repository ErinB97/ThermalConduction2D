# ThermalConduction2D
A model for solving 2-D heat conduction through multiple materials with user defined IVP's.
Model is solved using either Euler's method or 2nd order Runge-Kutta method.

Summary Report is found within the folder "Documents"

Instructions:
1. Run 'ThermalConduction2D.py'
2. Select material data from 'material_data.csv'
3. Load model example .csv file (model parameters such as tolerances and total time can be edited in CSV)
4. Select solve method with either 'euler' or 'RK'
