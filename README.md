# ThermalConduction2D
A model for solving 2-D heat conduction through multiple materials with user defined IVP's.

These are the initial notes I made for what I would like to include:

-Material represented by 2D array
--	each cell represents dX.dY
---		calculated at start (array)
--	properties unique to each cell
---		properties can be calculated for each cell
--	can be imported / designed by user
---		use excel spreadsheet + macros, or image tool such as paint.net to "paint" the materials and IVP
---   write a GUI instead (TKinter?)

-Initial Value Problem and Calculations
-- 	calculate for time T
--- 	use variety of solving methods
--  allow for properties to be re-calculated on each iteration instead of assuming constant

-Return results as a visual representation
-- 	Heatmap can show each property specified by user/pre-determined
--  Sub-plot of start and end condition
--  Make use of animation to show change of heat spread/properties with time?
